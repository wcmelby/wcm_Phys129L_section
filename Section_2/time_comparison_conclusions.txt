As you can see in the Figure "convex_hull_time_comparison.png", the amount of time needed to find the convex hull of a point cloud 
tends to increase as the number of points increases, in all four methods. There are only two notable exceptions: both Graham scan 
and Jarvis march both decrease time needed at large number of points n=1000. In general, the monotone chain seems to be fastest in 
all cases. Also, note that the axes are logarithmic, so the time needed increases as a power law fuction of n. 


For the point cloud with values from -5 to 5, the overall times look similar, on the order of 10^-4 s for low n and 10^-2 s for high n. 
This indicates that variance does not impact the time complexity of these functions. 

The Gaussian point distribution with variance 1 also has a similar time. 

When generating 100 point clouds with n=50 using a Gaussian distribution, the runtime histogram looks like a delta function, with 
almost all the values falling within the same bin. Each method has a few outliers though of trials that took much longer than average. 
The Graham scan has the greatest spread in times, which almost follows an exponential decay shape.

Quickhull: Fastest = 0.000264 sec, Slowest = 0.008309 sec
Monotone Chain: Fastest = 0.000156 sec, Slowest = 0.004876 sec
